# NE-50X-Dual-Syringe-Pump-Control-for-Extrusion-Process

This is open source work done by the Dr. Gerald Schneider Research group of Louisiana State University. 

This project provides a user friendly software for full control over two NE-50X syringe pumps working in unison of one another. These LABVIEW programs are particularly designed for automatic extrusion of liposomes. The subVIs are within the driver folder, within the NE-50X driver.

Be sure to be aware of the port connections from the pump to the computer, and set them according on the right of the user interface of the LABVIEW software. Follow the pump's instruction manual for basic setup of primary and secondary individualized pump setup.
